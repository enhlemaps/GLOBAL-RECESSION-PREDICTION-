# GLOBAL-RECESSION-PREDICTION-PROJECT

## Overview
This project aimed to predict global recessions using economic indicators. Our goal was to identify patterns and signals in global economic data that could help forecast whether a country is at risk of entering a recession. The solution involved building a machine learning model trained on global economic indicators and presenting insights through a report and visualizations.

The project was completed as part of a group of four students during the second year at BAC .

## Project Objectives
- Identify key economic indicators linked to global recessions
- Develop a predictive machine learning model using these indicators
- Visualize trends and insights using dashboards
- Present findings through a structured report and live presentation

## Tools & Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook (for Python scripting and model development)
- Latec (for report writing)
- Python with:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
- Microsoft Excel (data preparation and cleaning)
- Power BI ( data visualization)
